00:00.250 --> 00:03.500
Welcome to this minesweeper tutorial.

2
00:04.000 --> 00:09.500
In this tutorial I will show you how to play Minesweeper.

3
00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
To make the whole structure a little better for you,

4
00:13.500 -> 00:16.000
I divided the video into different chapters.

5
00:16.500 -> 00:21.500
So I don't want to keep you any longer and
start directly with the first chapter.

6
00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
In this chapter I will show you the best way to
to play minesweeper,

7
00:32.500 --> 00:36.000
because there are so many ways
how and where to play Minesweeper,

8
00:36.500 --> 00:40.500
but in this tutorial I want to show you what is probably the simplest
show possibility.

9
00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
To do this, open the browser of your choice.

10
00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
Then enter Google.com in the search field and press Enter.

11
00:50.500 --> 00:53.500
This will take you to the Google home page.

12
00:54.000 --> 00:59.500
Here you enter minesweeper in the search field
and then press Enter.

13
01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
The first thing that should come up
is a box in which you can play Minesweeper.

14
01:05.500 --> 01:12.000
If this is not the case and no such field would arise,
then you can also use one of the suggested websites.

15
01:12.500 -> 01:15.000
Because these websites are also very good.

16
01:15.500 -> 01:21.000
But as already said
we will play with Google's own minesweeper in the tutorial.

17
01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
So now you can press play and Minesweeper is already open.

18
01:31.000 --> 01:35.500
In this chapter I show you
How Minesweeper controls work.

19
01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Of course, the controls may vary slightly from game to game.

20
01:40.500 --> 01:42.000
But in most cases it is the same.

21
01:43.000 --> 01:45.500
There are actually two options for control.

22
01:46.000 --> 01:53.000
Either you make a left click on a field,
on which you move the mouse over.

23
01:53,500 --> 01:58.000
So if you now left-click, the field
which was clicked is revealed.

24
01:59.500 --> 02:05.000
Or you can use a right click
place a flag on a square

25
02:05.500 --> 02:07.500
or remove the flag again.

26
02:08.000 --> 02:14.000
It is also important that if there is a flag on a field,
that this field cannot be uncovered.

27
02:16.000 --> 02:23.000
You can try as many times as you want
the field can only be revealed after the flag has been removed.

28
02:24.500 --> 02:27.000
So, that was it with the controls.

29
02:27.500 --> 02:31.500
With the help of these you can now really start playing Minesweeper.

30
02:36.500 --> 02:41.000
In this chapter I will explain the rules of the game to you.

31
02:42.500 --> 02:47.000
Namely, it hid mines on the playing field.

32
02:47.500 --> 02:54.000
The goal now is to uncover all squares that have NO mines on them.

33
02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
Since this would not be possible without the help of the game, the game gives us a help.

34
03:01.500 --> 03:05.500
And you can see a few numbers here on the edge.

35
03:06.000 --> 03:14.000
These numbers indicate how many of the eight surrounding fields have a mine.

36
03:14.500 --> 03:19.500
So, for example, with this one, exactly one of these surrounding fields has a mine.

37
03:20.000 --> 03:25.500
For example, this deuce has two mines on the eight surrounding squares.

38
03:27.500 --> 03:35.000
It is important that if a field has no number, then all eight surrounding fields are without a mine.

39
03:36.000 --> 03:49.500
Now what's also cool is that Google minesweeper the surrounding fields
from empty clicked fields, also revealed at the same time,
because they don't all have mines.

40
03:52.000 --> 03:49.500
Once numbers come, it stops auto-revealing,
because then you have to find out for yourself which fields can be uncovered.

41
03:52.000 --> 04:00.000
As soon as numbers come, it stops auto-revealing,
because then you have to find out for yourself which ones can be uncovered.

42
04:00.500 --> 04:05.000
Now there is another example
for example you have a one here.

43
04:05.500 --> 04:10.500
This means that a mine is hidden under one of these eight surrounding fields.

44
04:11.000 -> 04:18.500
Now that seven of the surrounding fields have already been revealed
by automatically uncovering Google Minesweeper,

45
04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
it is now clear that the last face-down surrounding square is a mine.

46
04:23.500 -> 04:31.500
In such a case, I mark the mine with a flag,
then I know attention, there is a mine hidden underneath
and therefore do not want to uncover this field.

47
04:33.000 --> 04:44.500
Now you also have a one next door, because you now also know aha, the flag marks a mine,
this now means that all other fields surrounding this one do not have a mine.

48
04:45.000 --> 04:49.500
So I can uncover these fields without worry.

49
04:51.000 -> 04:59.500
I now apply this procedure to all fields,
until I finally uncovered all fields without a mine.

50
05:00.500 --> 05:08.000
It is important to note that if you click on a mine,
then the game is lost.

51
05:11.500 -> 05:13.500
Those were the rules.

52
05:18.500 -> 05:23.000
So, in this chapter we play a complete round of Minesweeper together.

53
05:23.500 --> 05:27.500
I recommend you to switch to the easiest difficulty at the beginning anyway.

54
05:28.000 --> 05:33.500
You can select the Easy difficulty level in the upper left corner.

55
05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
Once you've done that, you can now click anywhere on a square.

56
05:39.500 --> 05:43.500
I recommend clicking something in the middle rather than a corner.

57
05:44.500 --> 05:51.500
Now that the first few fields and numbers have revealed themselves,
I always like to start with the corners.

58
05:52.500 --> 05:59.000
And although you have a one there,
that means one of these eight surrounding fields has a mine,

59
05:59.500 --> 06:06.000
but seven of these squares are already uncovered,
that means that this field has to be a mine.

60
06:07.500 -> 06:12.000
Also here in this corner you have seven fields,
that have already been revealed

61
06:12.500 -> 06:18.000
and a space that is not yet revealed
and a mine, which must be present.

62
06:18.500 -> 06:22.000
That means it can only be this field.

63
06:23.500 --> 06:27.500
And you can already see that this is quite often the case.

64
06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
For example also here

65
06:29.500 -> 06:30.500
and here,

66
06:31.000 -> 06:32.000
as well as here.

67
06:33.000 -> 06:36.500
And you've already been able to mark six mines with it.

68
06:37.500 -> 06:41.500
Now in the next step I look, you have a one here

69
06:42.500 --> 06:44.500
and is already marked a mine.

70
06:45.000 -> 06:50.000
This means that these two other fields can no longer be mines,
since there is only one mine around this field.

71
06:51.000 -> 06:53.000
So you can easily uncover these fields.

72
06:54.000 --> 07:01.000
And now here too you have a one,
but all seven surrounding squares except the eighth are revealed.

73
07:01.500 -> 07:04.500
This means that only this field can be a mine.

74
07:07.500 -> 07:10.500
And here again, you have already marked a field.

75
07:11.000 -> 07:12.500
This means that this field cannot be a mine.

76
07:13.000 -> 07:17.000
Again, we already know where the mine is in this field.

77
07:18.500 -> 07:24.500
Now you have a two
and a square surrounding it is already marked.

78
07:26.500 -> 07:33.000
But there aren't any more fields around it,
which could be the second mine besides this one.

79
07:33.500 -> 07:36.000
So here's the mine for sure.

80
07:37.000 -> 07:42.000
Or even with this three, you have exactly three fields that are not yet revealed.

81
07:42.500 -> 07:49.000
Two of them are certainly mines, but that doesn't matter,
because the third field must also be a mine,

82
07:49.500 -> 07:52.000
because no other square can be a mine.

83
07:52.500 -> 07:58.500
With this logic you can mark or uncover an extremely large number of fields.

84
07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
For example also here, this one.

85
08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
You have the mine here, so this square here cannot be a mine.

86
08:04.500 --> 08:09.500
And here too, here you have the one,
so this square here can't be a mine either.

87
08:10.000 -> 08:15.000
Or here, here we have a one, here is already a mine,
so this field is not a mine.

88
08:16.000 -> 08:20.000
And here again you have a one, here is the mine.

89
08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Good, then these two squares can't be a mine.

90
08:26.500 --> 08:28.500
Here you have a three.

91
08:30.000 -> 08:40.000
These two squares are already marked with a flag
and the last facedown square in the three is this one.

92
08:40.500 --> 08:43.500
This means that this field must also be a mine.

93
08:45.500 --> 08:49.000
Exactly, now you have one more field and you have the one here.

94
08:51.500 --> 08:56.000
This field can therefore not be a mine, because there is already a mine here.

95
08:57.000 --> 09:00.000
And voila, you made it.

96
09:08.500 -> 09:12.000
Well, that's it for the minesweeper tutorial.

97
09:13.000 -> 09:19.500
If the game gets too easy for you,
I have three more ideas to take with you,
which makes the game more difficult.

98
09:20.500 --> 09:24.500
For example, you can simply try a more difficult level of difficulty.

99
09:25.500 -> 09:32.500
Or you can try to win in as little time as possible.

100
09:33.000 -> 09:38.500
Or you can even try to complete the game without right-clicking.

101
09:39.000 -> 09:44.500
This means that you cannot place flags during the game.

102
09:46.500 -> 09:53.000
So, those were already my ideas
and so thank you for your attention.
